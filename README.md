# graalVM-native-image

GraalVM Native Images are standalone executables that can be generated by processing compiled Java applications ahead-of-time. Native Images generally have a smaller memory footprint and start faster than their JVM counterparts.

Adventages: reduce startup time and memory consumption

### Use case ###
* Function as a service - serverless functions - functions  that take a request -> run -> shot down, does not need to be running al the time, functions that we deploy on Lambda!

 ### Where to avoid use AOT and graalVM! ###
* high trafic website
* frequent deployment
* big monolite applications

### Requirements! ###
* GraalVM installed and set in environemnt variables
* native-image installed
* Visual Studio C++	installed : https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
* give permission to the project to access to vcvarsall.bat:
  ```bash
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
```


### How to install and run application? ###
1. Clone the project and build it with the Gradle build tool in order to create a jar file (usually in the build directory).
2. Open cmd as administrator
3. Type: 
```bash
